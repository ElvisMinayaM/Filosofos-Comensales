# Commensal Philosophers

## Overview
Around a table sit 5 philosophers, who spend their lives thinking and having dinner. For each philosopher there is a plate of noodles, and a fork to the left of it, for as the noodles it is necessary to occupy two forks and each philosopher can only take the one to his left and right. If any philosopher takes a fork and the other is busy, he will wait with the fork in his hand, until he can take the other fork to start eating.
